<p>
    <em>Other Information:</em>
    In addition to any Personal Information or other information that you choose to submit to UCB directly (whether through the Site or in
    person), UCB and UCB’s third-party service providers may use a variety of technologies that automatically (or passively) store or collect certain
    information whenever you visit or interact with the Site (“Usage Information”). This Usage Information may be stored or accessed using a variety of
    technologies that may be downloaded to Member’s personal computer, browser, laptop, tablet, mobile phone or other device (a “Device”) whenever Member

    UCB may use various methods and technologies to store or collect Usage Information, including but limited to a database stored on a secure cloud, as well

    <strong>Information from Third Parties</strong>
</p>
<p>
    We may, from time to time, supplement the information that UCB collects directly from you with outside records from third parties for various purposes,
    including to enhance UCB’s ability to serve you, to tailor content to you, and to offer opportunities that may be of interest to you. To the extent UCB
    combines any non-personally identifiable information that we receive from a third party source with Personal Information collected from you, it will be
    treated as Personal Information and UCB will apply this Privacy Policy to such combined information, unless we have disclosed otherwise.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>User-Generated Content and Public Information.</strong>
</p>
<p>
    The Site may permit you to submit ideas, photographs, user profiles, writings, music, video, audio recordings, computer graphics, pictures, data,
    questions, comments, suggestions or other content, including Personal Information (collectively, “User Content”). UCB or others may store, display,
    reproduce, publish, distribute or otherwise use User Content online or offline in any media or format (currently existing or hereafter developed),
    consistent with the Terms of Use [link to Terms]. Others may have access to this User Content and may have the ability to share it with third parties. You
    should always keep in mind that public postings are not confidential, and that UCB does not control who will have access to the information you choose to
    make public and cannot guarantee that parties who have access to such publicly available information will respect your privacy or keep it secure. UCB is
    not responsible for the accuracy, use or misuse of any User Content that Member discloses or receives from third parties through the Service.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>How UCB Uses User Content and Personal Information</strong>
</p>
<p>
    Union Capital members earn social and financial rewards by engaging with our mission-driven partner schools, health centers, and community programs. In
    order to facilitate these rewards, UCB may share certain User Content with our partners. UCB will not share or sell your Personal Information for marketing
    purposes. However, we may provide de-identified or aggregate data to third parties. For example, UCB may inform third parties of the demographic breakdown
    of the registered users of the Site.
</p>
<p>
    In addition, UCB may use your Personal Information for the following reasons:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        To enable you to participate in the Program and the Site’s features, such as having UCB contact you to disseminate relevant information regarding
        events and opportunities;
    </li>
</ul>
<ul>
    <li>
        To process your registration with the Site, including verifying that your information is active and valid;
    </li>
</ul>
<ul>
    <li>
        Provide updates or inform you of new Site features that we will be of interest to you;
    </li>
</ul>
<ul>
    <li>
        Contact you with regard to your use of the Site and, in UCB’s discretion, changes to the Site and/or the Site’s policies;
    </li>
</ul>
<ul>
    <li>
        For internal business purposes; purposes disclosed to you at the time you provide your information, or as otherwise set forth in this Privacy Policy;
    </li>
</ul>
<ul>
    <li>
        To provide you with information or services or process transactions that you have requested or agreed to receive, including electronic newsletters or
        marketing materials; and
    </li>
</ul>
<ul>
    <li>
        To ensure that content on the Site is presented in the most effective manner on your Device.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    In addition, UCB may, in its sole discretion, share or transfer Personal Information where permitted or required by law, to comply with legal process, to
    interact with anti-fraud databases, to protect Member’s vital interests, to protect the security or integrity of the Site or UCB’s databases, to enforce
    the Terms of Use or protect UCB’s business or reputation, to take precautions against legal liability, to protect and defend the UCB’s rights or property,
    for required institutional risk control, or for resolving disputes, inquiries or complaints with respect to Member’s use of the Site. UCB also reserves the
    right to disclose and transfer all such information: (i) to a subsequent owner, co-owner or operator of the Site or applicable database; or (ii) in
    connection with a merger, consolidation, restructuring, the sale of substantially all of UCB’s interests and/or assets or other organizational change,
    including, during the course of any due diligence process. UCB will take all commercially reasonable measures in an effort to protect your privacy and
    Personal Information. In the event UCB goes through a business transition, such as a merger, acquisition by another organization, or sale of all or a
    portion of its assets, Personal Information might be among the assets transferred. We will notify you of any such change in ownership or control of your
    Personal Information.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Interactions with Third-Party Sites </strong>
</p>
<p>
    The Site may include functionality that allows certain kinds of interactions between the Site and Member’s account on a third-party web site or
    application. The use of this functionality may involve the third-party operator providing certain information, including Personal Information, to UCB. For
    example, when you register with the Site, you may have an option to use your Facebook, Google or other account provided by a third-party site or
    application to facilitate the registration and log-in or transaction process on the Site, or otherwise link accounts. If we offer and you choose to use
    this functionality to access the Site, the third-party site or application may send Personal Information about you to the Site. If so, we will then treat
    it as Personal Information under this Privacy Policy, since UCB would be collecting in connection with the Site. In addition, UCB may provide third-party
    links on the Site to facilitate Member’s sending a communication from the Site. For example, we may use third parties to facilitate emails, text messages,
    blog postings, tweets or Facebook postings. These third parties may retain any information used or provided in any such communications or other activities
    and these third parties’ practices are not subject to this Privacy Policy. UCB may not control or have access to Member’s communications through these
    third parties. Except as set forth in herein, this Policy does not apply to third-party sites or services. You should carefully review the applicable
    third-party privacy policies before using any such third-party tool on the Site.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Security</strong>
</p>
<p>
    UCB has taken steps to ensure that your Personal Information is secure and protected from loss, unauthorized access, unauthorized disclosure, misuse,
    destruction or alteration. However, there is always some risk involved in transmitting information over the Internet. UCB cannot ensure or warranty the
    security and privacy of any information Member transmits to UCB. Any of Program or the Site (or both) is done at your own risk. In the event that you
    suspects any unauthorized use of your account or password, you should notify UCB immediately.
